The purpose of the system is to give a live GPS position of ROVs, divers and other moving objects below the water surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Underwater GPS system is based on Short Baseline (SBL) acoustic positioning. The Locator is placed on the device to be positioned and functions as a beacon that send out an acoustic pulse. Near the surface, there are four Receiver hydrophones lowered into the water. The Receivers listen for the pulse from the locator. Time-of-arrival to each Receiver is used to calculate the Locator\u2019s position.

More separation is better, but 2x2 meters is sufficient for good performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Range\n\n\nThere should be maximum of 100m from any Receiver to the Locator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiver Depth\n\n\nPlace the Receivers at a few meters depth. Near the surface there are typically small air bubbles caused by waves. These small air bubbles attenuate the \nacoustic signal and can reduce the system performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit search area\n\n\nYou will get a better position if you help the search algorithm to narrow the \nsearch area. Limit the search range setting to the area where the Locator is \nexpected to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectivity\n\n\nThe Receivers and Locators are fully omnidirectional and transmits/receives equally good in all directions. The only direction with less performance is backwards where the cable enters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiver stability\n\n\nAdd some weight to the Receiver cable just above the Receiver so they hang straight down in the water\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn board GPS\n\n\nIf the master electronics is static during operation it is recommended to use the static option for the GPS. This is to remove the inaccuracy of the GPS Receiver in global position. Only use onboard GPS when the reference system is moving eg. if mounted to a boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Systems\n\n\nIn order to calculate the absolute position of the Locator we need to define two reference systems, the acoustic and the global reference system. The global reference system is defined by latitude and longitude and is the reference system used by the GPS and in maps.\n\n\n\n\nThe acoustic reference system  (the x and y axis) is defined by the orientation of the housing. The housing is by definition located in origin (x=0, y=0).  A label on top of the lid indicates the x-y coordinate system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoat Example\n\n\nThe illustration bellow shows a typical Receiver configuration when installed on a boat. The Receivers are hanging from the side of the boat, one in each corner. The depth of the Receivers are typically 2-4m, deep enough to get below the hull and get free line-of-sight to the Locator.

We do this first because we want the GPS receiver to start receiving signals and acheive a lock while we setup the rest of the system. If you are using the Locator-S1, power it on now so it also have time to get GPS lock.\n\n\nCalibrate IMU\n\n\nConnect the Ethernet cable to the topside unit and your computer. Then open your web browser and type in the IP-address of your topside unit which is defined by the position of the dip-switch on the Master-D1. How to change the IP-address is described \nhere\n. At the top bar on the GUI you will see a calibration bar for the IMU. To calibrate the IMU rotate it in a figure of 8 and keep doing it until the IMU calibration bar becomes full and green.\n\n\nDeploying of receivers\n\n\nBefore starting to deploy the receivers in the water, add a piece of tape on the receiver cable on the desired depth to make setup easier. Place the receivers in the water on the desired location and decide which number (1-4) each receiver will have. This is important when connecting the receivers to the topside unit.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nAdding lead weights just above the receiver helps keep them stable when doing the positioning.\n\n\n\n\nConnect everything\n\n\nWhen connecting the receiver cables to the topside unit remember the numbering you decided on and connect the connector to the accordingly port. If this is not correct the position will be completely wrong. Next you connect the Locator if you are using the A1 or D1.\n\n\n\n\nSelect locator and channel\n\n\nNow that everything is connected and ready it is time to select the right locator and choose which channal to listen on. This is configurated on the setting page of the web GUI. The Water Linked standard is to use channel 17 and this is also the default channel for the Locator-S1.\n\n\nConfigure receiver placement and seach range in GUI\n\n\nAfter selecting the correct locator, you need to provide the correct placement of the receivers to the GUI for the positioning to work correctly. This is done by drag'n drop of each receiver to the correct placment relative to the topside unit. The position of each receiver is seen below in the map view. It you click on the receiver you get a pop up with the possibility to write its exact placment. Once this is done you can limit the search range by using the same drag and drop feature.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you are using the Locator-A1 or S1, you need to provid depth information to the topside unit. Description on how to do this is found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nReducing the search range helps to improve the performance of the system. It is recomended to limith this range if you are operating in a smaller area. This is especially important in tanks.\n\n\n\n\nYou are now ready to explore the underwater world and knowing where you are at the same time.",
