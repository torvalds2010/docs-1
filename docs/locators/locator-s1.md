# Locator-S1

## Description

The Locator-S1 carries an internal GPS based time sync module. Because of this, the S1 does not require tether integration for top-side communication. It only requires external power 10-18V to be provided from the underwater device. 

Some Locator-S1 attributes can be configured using an integrated UART interface. This configuration is optional and not required for normal operation. Before deployment in water, the Locator-S1 needs to achieve a GPS lock. The integrated status-LED shows the condition of the GPS lock.

As the Locator-S1 does not carry its own depth sensor, the depth needs to be provided from the underwater vehicle (ROV etc.) to the topside Master-D1 using the software API. Example of how to perform this can be found [here](https://waterlinked.github.io/docs/explorer-kit/gui/api/).

## LED Signals

* Fixed green light: GPS lock is acheived. The unit is ready to dive.

* Flashing green light (fast): Searching for GPS lock. The unit is not ready to dive.

* Flashing green light (slow): GPS lock has been acheived but lost. The unit is ready to dive.

* No green light: Power is off.

## Benefits

* GPS based sync removes all tether requirements enabling very easy integration with any ROV.

* Extremely small size making it perfect for even the smallest underwater vehicles.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)

## Wiring interface

The tables below shows the pinning of the S1 interface.

| Interface           | Color |
| :------------------ | :-- |
| Positive (10-18V) | Orange  |
| Negative | Orange/White   |
| UART RX | Brown  |
| UART TX | Brown/White   |

## Terminal Interface

The Locator-S1 has a simple UART interface which is used to change the channel of the locator. 

| Settings           | Value |
