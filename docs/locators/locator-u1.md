## Description

The Locator-U1 is a battery powered, digital hydro acoustic locator device. It carries an internal GPS based time sync module, which means no tether is required. This Locator fits well for divers, ROVs where power is not easily accessible, or other underwater applications.

The internal battery is rechargeable using a USB-C charger. Fully charged, the U1 will be operational for approximately 6 hours. Before deployment in water, the Locator-U1 needs to achieve a GPS lock. The integrated status-LED shows the condition of the GPS lock.

The Locator-U1 has a rotary switch located on the inside of the cap. This switch is used to change the channel on which the Locator is transmitting. The same channel needs to be selected in the Water Linked Underwater GPS GUI.

The Locator has 3 mounting holes on each side for M3 screws. A default bracket is included.

## LED Signals

* Flashing green light (fast): Searching for GPS lock. The unit is **not ready** to dive.

* Fixed green light: GPS lock is acheived. The unit is ready to dive.

* Flashing green light (slow): GPS lock has been acheived but lost. The unit is ready to dive.

* No green light: Power is off and the unit is not ready for diving.

## Benefits

* Battery powered operation removes all cable requirements enabling easy operation.

* Extremely small size making it perfect for on-body applications like diving or retrofitting on ROV.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)

## Wiring interface

Because the U1 is battery powered the only interface for it is the charing port which is a standard USB-C type connector.
